</h3>
          <p>
            Staring at your Kate Moss shower curtain <br />
            Lying on the bathroom floor naked <br />
            Hiding coke inside all your orange pixie sticks <br />
            You take a rail & spread it on your tit <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ve had a long list of lovers, <br />
            But none of them matter to you except me <br />
            I’ve had a long list of lovers, <br />
            But none of them matter to me except you <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Sesame syrup, <br />
            I heard it a long time ago <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a small black notebook <br />
            That you keep hidden underneath your bed I’ve seen before <br />
            It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy <br />
            You’ve ever been with… <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            & we fall asleep to the scent of long stemmed roses <br />
            Always dreaming of sex on the ceiling <br />
            & we sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses <br />
            Always dreaming of sex on the ceiling... <br />
          </p>
