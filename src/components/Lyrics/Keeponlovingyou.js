          <h3>Keep on loving you</h3>
          <p>
          You should've seen by the look in my eyes <br />
That there was something missing <br />
You should've known by the tone of my voice, <br />
But you didn't listen <br />
You play dead, but you never bled <br />
Instead you lie still in the grass all coiled up & hissing <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          & I know all about those men <br />
Still I don't remember <br />
Because it was us baby way before them <br />
& we're still together <br />
& I meant every word I said <br />
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          & I'm gonna keep on loving you <br />
Because it's the only thing I wanna do <br />
I don't wanna sleep <br />
I just wanna keep on loving you <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          & I meant every word I said <br />
When I said that I love you I meant that I loved you forever... <br />
