        <p>You would use your songs to say the words you couldn’t say  <br />
            & every word you sang was about you & me <br />
          </p>
          <p>
             I loved everything you wrote <br />
            & when you would sing I felt that my heart was falling <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          You’re all I want <br />
            We fucked so hot it left me faded <br />
            For all you are <br />
            There is no other love, it’s only yours <br />
            You’re all I want, all I love <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          & with Cristal & pink champagne,  <br />
        On our wedding day you had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us <br />

          <p>
          Then you got on top of it & you sang to me as the snow was <br />
           falling…
