        <p>Give me the pistol, aim it high  <br />
          I’m out in the desert shooting at the sky <br />
          Guess I really miss you & I don’t know what else to do <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          Beautiful pictures that you took of us <br />
          Used to hang up there on your bedroom walls, <br />
          But you took them all down now & you put them into a <br />
          drawer <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          You’ve been on my mind,  <br />
          You’ve been on my mind,  <br />
          You’ve been on my mind so long I can’t deal with it <br />
          </p>
          <p>
          You’ve been on my mind  <br />
          & I’ll waste my time until you lift me off the floor & <br />
          love me again <br />

          <p>
          I know if I saw you & we kissed just once <br />
          You could be happy, maybe you’d come back <br />
          Because I really miss you, don’t know how much more I can <br />
          take…<br />
          </p>
