          <p>
            I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back <br />
            We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check <br />
            We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached, <br />
            But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at <br />{" "}
            me then
          </p>
          <p>
            Kristen, come right back <br />
            I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed <br />
            When you light the candle <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            & on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now <br />
            & I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall <br />
            Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head <br />{" "}
            to toe <br />
            Think I like you best when you're just with me & no one else...{" "}
            <br />
            & I'm kissing you lying in my room <br />
            Holding you until you fall asleep <br />
            & it's just as good as I knew it would be <br />
            Stay with me <br />
            I don't want you to leave... <br />
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
